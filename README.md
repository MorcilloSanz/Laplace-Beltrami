# Laplace-Beltrami
In differential geometry, the Laplace–Beltrami operator is a generalization of the Laplace operator to functions defined on submanifolds in Euclidean space and, even more generally, on Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. It is named after Pierre-Simon Laplace and Eugenio Beltrami.

The Laplace–Beltrami operator, like the Laplacian, is the (Riemannian) divergence of the (Riemannian) gradient:
$$\Delta f = div\left( \nabla f\right)$$
